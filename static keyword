/** static: : A static member belongs to the class rather than to an object.
The static keyword in Java is used to create class-level variables and methods. 
Static members are shared across all instances of a class, 
and they can be accessed without creating an object of the class.
Static variables are shared across all instances of a class. 
This means that if you change the value of a static variable in one instance of the class,
 the change will be reflected in all other instances of the class.
Static methods can be called without creating an object of the class. 
This makes them useful for utility methods that are not specific to any particular
instance of the class. */
