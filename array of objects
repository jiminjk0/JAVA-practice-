/**drawbacks of array
 *
1) The size of the array cannot be increased or decreased once it is declaredâ€”arrays have a fixed size.
2) Java cannot store heterogeneous data. It can only store a single type of primitives.
3) You cannot insert a new element at the middle of the array. In the same way you cannot delete elements from the middle of the array.
You can only insert/delete from the end of the array.
4)To delete or, change the elements of an array you need to traverse throughout
the array which increases the time complexity. */
