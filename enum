// enum : it also supports if and else and switch

/** Enum, introduced in Java 5, is a special data type that consists of
 *  a set of pre-defined named values separated by commas. 
 * These named values are also known as elements or enumerators or enum instances.
 *  Since the values in the enum type are constant,
 *  you should always represent them in UPPERCASE letters. */

// enum is a class but can't extends we can use methods, constructors here
enum Status {

  RUNNING, FAILED, PENDING, SUCSESS; // objects
}

 public class main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
      int i = 5;
      Status s = Status.RUNNING;
      Status[] s1 = Status.values(); // all of the objects adding []cause it's an array
      // using for loop to print all 
      s.
      for(Status j : s1){
        System.out.println(j);
        System.out.println(j.ordinal()); // prints all the order 
      }
     
    
    }
