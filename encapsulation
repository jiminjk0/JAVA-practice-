// Encapsulation
/** It is the mechanism of bundling data and methods into a single unit, called a class. 
Encapsulation helps to protect the data from being accessed directly and manipulated, leading to mistakes.
In Java, encapsulation can be achieved by declaring class variables as private and providing public 
getter and setter methods to access and update the value of a private variable.*/

class Human
{
       private int age;  // this variable is now only accessable in the same class
       private String name;

        // only way to access this is by methods. set and get

       public void setAge(int j){
          age=j;
       }

       public void setName(String temp){
        name=temp;
     }
     
     // returns value 
       public int getAge(){

        return age;
       }             

       public String getName(){
        
        return name;
       }
}


class main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Human obj = new Human(); // creating object

        //setting age and name of obj
        obj.setAge(20);
        obj.setName("rajanya");


        // print
        System.out.println(obj.getAge() + " " + obj.getName());
